### Install Gulp Globally

Gulp must be installed globally in order to use the command line tools.


```
npm install -g gulp
```

### Install npm dependencies

```
npm install
```

This runs through all dependencies listed in `package.json` and downloads them
to a `node_modules` folder in your project directory.


### Run gulp and be amazed.

```
gulp
```
